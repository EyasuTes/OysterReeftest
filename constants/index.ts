            degraded marine ecosystems. Our proprietary Reef Tiles, the world's
            first 3D-printed from terracotta clay, have proven to be a
            game-changer in coral restoration efforts. With a coral survivorship
            rate of 95%, these tiles significantly outperform traditional
            methods. Such success has garnered Archireef recognition from
            organizations including the World Economic Forum, IUCN, and Geneva
            Inventions.`,
