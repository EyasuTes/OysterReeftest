  description: `Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world.
            Coral polyps, the animals primarily responsible for building reefs,
            can take many forms: large reef building colonies, graceful flowing
            fans, and even small, solitary organisms. Thousands of species of
            corals have been discovered; some live in warm, shallow, tropical
            seas and others in the cold, dark depths of the ocean.Because of the
            diversity of life found in the habitats created by corals, reefs are
            often called the "rainforests of the sea." About 25% of the ocean's
            fish depend on healthy coral reefs. Fishes and other organisms
            shelter, find food, reproduce, and rear their young in the many
            nooks and crannies formed by corals.`,

  description: `In the face of escalating environmental challenges, the importance of artificial reefs as havens for marine life cannot be overstated. They offer a beacon of hope in a changing world, providing refuge, resilience, and rejuvenation for our oceans' fragile ecosystems.
At the Fujairah Research Centre, we use artificial reefs as essential tools in ecosystem restoration and fisheries management. By attracting fish and other marine life, we help replenish depleted populations, supporting both commercial and recreational fishing industries. 
Our marine researchers monitor the effectiveness of artificial reefs location, design, and material composition to ensure compatibility with local ecosystems and long-term sustainability.
